1. Histogram

Code: (we already wrote).
Analysis:

A histogram shows the frequency distribution of intensity levels (0–255).

It is useful for: contrast analysis, detecting brightness issues, thresholding, equalization.

Example: A dark image has most pixels clustered in the left (low intensity).

In exams, you can explain: “Histogram is used to understand image characteristics before enhancement or segmentation.”

🔹 2. Gray Level Transformation

Operations: Negative, Log, Gamma.
Analysis:

Negative: 255 – img → highlights dark regions, useful for medical imaging (X-rays).

Log transform: Expands dark regions, compresses bright → useful for images with high dynamic range.

Power-law (gamma): Enhances either dark or bright regions depending on γ < 1 or > 1.
👉 These are used to improve visibility and contrast for human interpretation.

🔹 3. Edge Detection

Why needed?

Edges represent boundaries of objects.

Detecting edges helps in object detection, shape analysis, segmentation.

Masks: Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian → highlight intensity changes.

Canny (multi-step): gives thin and accurate edges (gradient + non-max suppression + thresholding).
👉 Example: In self-driving cars, edges detect road lanes.

🔹 4. Binary Image Analysis (Connected Components)

Analysis:

Converts grayscale → binary (object vs background).

Connected Component Labeling: Finds separate objects in a binary image.

Useful in OCR (finding letters), medical imaging (tumor detection), industrial inspection (counting objects).
👉 You can say: “It gives unique labels to different objects so that further analysis (like size, shape, count) can be done.”

🔹 5. Arithmetic & Logical Operations

Operations: Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR.
Analysis:

Addition: Enhances brightness or merges two images (e.g., blending watermark on an image).

Subtraction: Used for change detection (motion detection, background subtraction in video).

AND: Extracts overlapping parts (e.g., masking specific regions).

OR: Combines information from two images.
👉 Example Q: Why do we add two images?
Answer: “To merge information from multiple sources, like overlaying a watermark, or enhancing medical images by combining scans.”

🔹 6. Sampling & Quantization

Analysis:

Sampling: Reduces spatial resolution (rows/cols). Used in compression (smaller images).

Quantization: Reduces gray levels. Used in fax, low-bit displays, compression.
👉 Example: A 2-bit quantized image has only 4 intensity levels → reduces memory but may lose detail.

🔹 7. Thresholding (Binary, Otsu, Multi)

Analysis:

Binary Threshold: Simple object/background separation (good when background intensity is uniform).

Otsu’s Method: Automatically finds threshold by maximizing variance between foreground & background.

Multi-thresholding: Separates image into multiple regions.
👉 Applications: Document binarization (OCR), medical segmentation, license plate detection.

🔹 8. Zero Order Hold (ZOH) & First Order Hold (FOH)

Analysis:

ZOH: Nearest neighbor replication → blocky, pixelated enlargement. Simple, fast.

FOH (bilinear): Smoother enlargement using interpolation.
👉 Applications:

ZOH → when speed matters (real-time video).

FOH → when quality matters (image editing, medical imaging).
👉 Viva Q: Why not always use FOH?
Because it’s slower, requires computation.

🔹 9. Basic Image Operations

Examples: Flip, Rotate, Crop.
Analysis:

Flip: Horizontal (mirror), Vertical → data augmentation.

Rotate: Alignment of images (useful in OCR, medical scans).

Crop: Focuses on region of interest.
👉 Example: In face recognition, cropping extracts just the face region for further processing.
